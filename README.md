## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v10 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Monorepo Structure

This repository uses Nx as a build system with a focus on monorepo development:

- `apps/` - Contains application projects
  - `frontend/` - React frontend application
  - `backend/` - Node.js backend with GraphQL API
- `libs/` - Contains shared library projects

## Applications

### Frontend

A React application built with Vite and React Router.

**Features:**
- Video clip browsing and search
- Share button to copy shareable links with rich preview support
- Video playback on demand
- Real-time search with debouncing

**Start the frontend:**
```bash
npx nx serve frontend
```

### Backend

A Node.js application with TypeScript that provides a GraphQL API using Apollo Server and TypeGraphQL.

**Features:**
- GraphQL API with type-safe resolvers
- JWT-based authentication using AWS Cognito
- OpenSearch integration for video clips storage
- Video clip management (create, list)
- S3 presigned URL generation for secure video uploads
- Video file storage with CloudFront delivery
- **Automatic generation of static HTML pages with Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for rich link previews**

**Start the backend:**
```bash
npx nx serve backend
```

The GraphQL endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

**Rich Link Previews:**
When creating a video clip, the backend automatically generates a static HTML page with Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags. This page is uploaded to S3 and served via CloudFront, enabling rich previews in messaging apps and social media platforms without requiring JavaScript execution. See [docs/OPEN_GRAPH_META_TAGS.md](docs/OPEN_GRAPH_META_TAGS.md) for details.

**Example GraphQL queries:**

```graphql
# Get hello message
{
  hello
}

# Get all video clips
{
  videoClips {
    id
    name
    description
    userId
    createdAt
  }
}

# Create a video clip (requires authentication)
mutation CreateVideoClip($input: CreateVideoClipInput!) {
  createVideoClip(input: $input) {
    id
    name
    description
    userId
    s3Key
    videoUrl
    createdAt
  }
}

# Generate presigned URL for video upload (requires authentication)
mutation GenerateUploadUrl($fileName: String!, $contentType: String!) {
  generateUploadUrl(fileName: $fileName, contentType: $contentType) {
    uploadUrl
    s3Key
    videoUrl
  }
}
```

## Available Commands

### Development

- `npm start` - Serve the default application
- `npm run build` - Build the default project
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint the code

### Nx Commands

- `npm run affected` - Run commands only on projects affected by changes
- `npm run graph` - Show the dependency graph of the workspace

### Using Nx Directly

You can also use Nx directly for more advanced commands:

```bash
# Run a specific task for a specific project
npx nx <target> <project>

# Example: build a specific app
npx nx build my-app

# Run affected tests
npx nx affected:test

# View the dependency graph
npx nx graph
```

## Creating New Projects

### Create a new application

```bash
npx nx g @nx/node:application my-app
# or for a web app
npx nx g @nx/web:application my-app
```

### Create a new library

```bash
npx nx g @nx/js:library my-lib
```

## Backend Scripts

### Cleanup S3 Script

This script helps you identify and optionally clean up unused S3 objects related to video clips.

**Build the backend first:**
```bash
npx nx build backend
```

**Run the cleanup script (dry run):**
```bash
ENV_PATH=apps/backend/.env node dist/backend/apps/backend/scripts/cleanup-s3.js --dry-run
```

- Remove `--dry-run` to actually delete unused S3 objects.

### Process Clips Script

This script processes a CSV of video clips, downloads source files, trims videos, generates thumbnails and blurhashes, uploads to S3, and registers clips in the backend.

**Build the backend first:**
```bash
npx nx build backend
```

**Run the process-clips script:**
From the root of the repository:
```bash
node dist/backend/apps/backend/scripts/process-clips.js
```

- Make sure your `.env` file is configured with the necessary credentials and endpoints.
- The script expects the CSV file at `apps/backend/Video Clips - Sheet1.csv`.
- See comments in `apps/backend/scripts/process-clips.ts` for configuration details.
